# ZHV-0519 Customizations
This repository is an ongoing set of 3d-printed customizations for the ZHV-0519 solenoid valve (Zonhen Electric Appliances). Currently includes files for: a 2-port 2-way Normally Open cap and a 3-port 2-way cap (default when purchasing online). Both files are fully parametric and meant for Autodesk Fusion 360. [Original documentation for the valve can be found here.](http://www.zonhen.com/solenoid/ZHV-0519-en.html) 

## Repository Structure

* `Parametric models` contains Autodesk Fusion 360 models for each caps and are fully parametric.
* `Static models` contains STL files for each cap.

## 2-port, 2-way, Normally Open cap

![2P2W_NO_Cap](https://github.com/jasxflowers/ZHV-0519-Customs/blob/master/Images/2P2W_NO_Cap.png)

This design is most similar to Zonhen's Seat A interface for the solenoid valve. 

## 3-port, 2-way cap

![3P2W_Cap](https://github.com/jasxflowers/ZHV-0519-Customs/blob/master/Images/3P2W_Cap.PNG)

This is the default Seat B interface. The key difference is the addition of a barb for the top port, which is not usually available with Zonhen's cap.
