# ZHV-0519 Customizations
This repository is an ongoing set of customizations for the ZHV-0519 solenoid valve (Zonhen Electric Appliances). Currently includes files for: a 2-port 2-way Normally Open cap (similar to Zonhen's Seat A interface) and a 3-port 2-way cap (default Seat B interface). Both files are fully parametric. [Original documentation for the valve can be found here.](http://www.zonhen.com/solenoid/ZHV-0519-en.html)
